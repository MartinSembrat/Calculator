# Intive.Java
# Math Calculator


The program enables mathematical operations on real numbers, vectors and matrices.

## Description


After starting the program, the user is asked to enter the first object on which the calculations will be actioned.

Depending on the type of the first object entered, the possible mathematical operations will be displayed.

User will be asked to enter the second object -even if it is not required as in the case of selecting square as the math operation- (in compliance to the documentation). 
The result will be displayed. User will be able to repeat the sequence or terminate the program.

## Constraints
Matrix must have equal length of each line. 
In the case of matrix multiplication, the first matrix should have the number of rows equal to the number of columns in the second matrix.
All number are a float type with all its limitations.
If both objects are vectors they must be the same length.
