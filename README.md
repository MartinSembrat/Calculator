# Math Calculator


The program enables mathematical operations on real numbers, vectors and matrices.

## Description

After starting the program, the user is asked to enter the first object on which the calculations will be actioned.

Depending on the type of the first object entered, the possible mathematical operations will be displayed.

The options for selecting the second math object will be displayed depending on the selected math operation. 

User will be asked to enter the second object. 

The result will be displayed. User will be able to repeat the sequence or terminate the program.

## Constraints
All rows of the matrix must be same size.
In the case of matrix multiplication, the first matrix must have the number of rows equal to the number of columns in the second matrix.
All real numbers are a float type with all its limitations.
If both objects are vectors they must be the same size.
